The MiniAPI was created as a as minimal as possible development context for multimedia applications,
providing as much features as possible. It was primairly targetted for the Mobile C Compiler, but
the support was extended to any compiler who would to use it.

The code is written in C and is cross-platform.

It supports:
- Advanced collision detection techniques and aligned-axis bounding box trees
- Simple shapes drawing (surfaces, spheres and cylinders)
- Landscape generator
- Rover model
- Quake I (.mdl) and Quake II (.md2) models
- Ray Casting 3D engine (like those used in Wolfenstein or Doom)
- Particle system
- Shader (OpenGL 2.0)
- Sound playing

The project contains the following dirs:
- [All compilers]     Contains the demos and libraries for all compilers other than Mobile C Compiler
- [Mobile C Compiler] Contains the demos and libraries for the Mobile C Compiler

NOTE The MiniAPI source code is identical in [All compilers] and [Mobile C Compiler]
